    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 175 degrees C.</li>
        
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna sheets 
            and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and lay noodles flat
            on foil to cool.</li>
        
        <li>Mix ricotta, eggs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        
        <li>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat; add garlic and sauté 2 minutes. 
            Stir in spaghetti sauce and Italian seasoning until warmed through, stirring 
            occasionally, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with a 
            layer of noodles. Spread 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over noodles; top with another 
            layer of noodles. Pour 1 1/2 cups of sauce over noodles and spread the remaining

            mozzarella. Cover with a greased sheet of foil.</li>
